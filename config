## Config
##
## This file is the configuration file for:
## install.sh 
## run_virulencefinder.sh
## cleanup.sh
##
## All the paths must be included and put in quotation marks and without a "/" at the end

## Conda environment (DO NOT CHANGE!)
conda_env="FBI_virulencefinder"

## Working folder where the scripts and config files should be placed
work_dir="FSC_VirulenceFinder"

## Tools location (DO NOT CHANGE!)
tools_dir=$work_dir"/tools" 

## Results location
out_dir="FSC_VirulenceFinder/results"

## Location of the new/updated virulence database before indexing
## It is the folder that contains database.fsa
new_database="VirulenceFinder/database"

### Location of the database after being indexed
### Leave it inside the work_dir within the the tools folder
indexed_database=$tools_dir"/fsc_virulencefinder_db"

## Location of the folder with genomes
genomes="FSC_VirulenceFinder/test_genomes"

## Use subset option
## 0 = all genomes are used
## 1 = subset of genomes used
use_subset=0

## Program option
## 0 = both run_virulencefinder and run_serotypefinder on fastas
## 1 = run_virulencefinder on fastas
## 2 = run_serotypefinder on fastas
## 3 = run_virulencefinder on raw reads
program=3
